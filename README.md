# Trash4Treasure

Free forniture user friendly exchange platform, optimized for web and mobile device use. This project aims to reduce waste and trash produciton in favor of a more circular kind of economy, where goods are not thrown away but instead picked up for free by someone who maybe interested in them. 

It takes time and effort to dispose of an old couch or wardrobe trough conventional ways, and at the same time there are people looking exactly for what you are trying to waste, wouldn't it be easier if the two of you can share a common place where to find each other and resolve your mutual problem?
